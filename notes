Biuild frontend


npm run build

This builds react files

Send these static files to npm express static so index.html is served from node server

CORS changes, should not need any headers now (hopefully) test this out


In fronend change axios localhost to instance IP with some env var - first issue

After, all other issues were related to CORS


TODO:

Use docker-compose to run both as one file. Build react first, don't run react server and node server, only run node server.

Figure out a way to run docker compose using systemd service so we have automatic restarts.
